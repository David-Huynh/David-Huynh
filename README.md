## Hi there ğŸ‘‹ I'm David!

I love all things machine learning, neural networks, and statistics. \
In the wild you can find me trying all the new restaurants, rock climbing, and occasionally tinkering with my home lab.

ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on an AI generated image classifier using Transformers and CNN.
