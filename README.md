## Hi there 👋 I'm David!

I love all things machine learning, neural networks, and statistics. \
In the wild you can find me trying all the new restaurants, rock climbing, and occasionally tinkering with my home lab.

🌱 I'm currently studying Data Science and Machine Learning at the University of Toronto!

🔭 I’m currently working on an AI generated image classifier using Transformers and CNN.
